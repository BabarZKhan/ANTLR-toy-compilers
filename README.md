# Toy Compilers

This repository contains simple toy compilers taken from [bkiers](https://github.com/bkiers) repository. The original developer has demonstrated how to create a small dynamically typed programming language called Tiny Language using ANTLR. Since the source code is "unlicensed", I have been making changes to the design patterns for the sake of my learning.
