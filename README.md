# Toy Compilers

This repository contains simple toy compilers developed by [bkiers](https://github.com/bkiers) repository. The original developer has demonstrated how to create a small dynamically typed programming language called Tiny Language using ANTLR. I have been making changes to the visitor design patterns for some the compilers I have been working on.
